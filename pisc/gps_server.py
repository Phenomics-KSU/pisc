        More robust way of making sure that the UTC time the sensor control uses is accurate.
        To use this method effectively the client should be setup with the RelativePreciseTimeSource.
        This method uses the following steps to greatly reduce the latency effects between the client and server.
        
        This method should be called for each new UTC time until it reports success (returns true). 
        
        Handler: Records system time and id number
        Handler: Sends UTC time (with processing delay added in) and id number
        Client: Stores UTC time + id number + its system clock
        Client: Acknowledges packet by sending back same ID number.
        Handler: Calculates round trip time (RTT) and then sends back same ID and RTT value.
        Client: Cuts RTT value in half to estimate latency and adds it to the original UTC time it stored with the ID and system clock.
        Client: Checks if it has at least 10 messages.   If it does then adds checks if they're all consistent.  If they are then sends back 'true'. 
        
        This method returns true if client is successfully synced.  After that orientation and position messages can start being sent.
